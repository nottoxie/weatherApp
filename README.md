# weatherApplication
I will use React.js to make a front-end website which takes weather-api's and shows the weather.

To start the project:

<li>Step 1: Download node.js from https://nodejs.org/en and install.</li>
<li>Step 2: Open VSCode and open the desired folder.</li>
<li>Step 3: Right Click on the Created Folder then click the option "Open in Integrated Terminal."</li>
<li>Step 4: Type "npx create-react-app (project name: in this case "website-weather-app")" and also type: "npm install react-router-dom" </li>
<li>Step 5: Type "cd" and press tab to autofill and then click enter.</li>
<li>Step 6: Type "npm start"</li>

That's How to Set Up a React App in VSCode using Node.js
